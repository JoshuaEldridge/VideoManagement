## Testing
Here are some test cases:
1. Single Video File (Script run from same or different directory). File with fully qualified path or not.
2. List of files passed into the script
3. Directory of files passed in, includes sub directories
4. Various file types (mpg, m4v, mpv, avi, mov, dv) with none or more scene changes.
5. Scene at the end of the file (longer than the length of the file?)
